This is a fairly simple hobby OS the current stage is just a kernel. Obviously it's not complete  
I'm not spending much time on this readme Though I'll document here stuff you need to know  
If you have time you can go to Issues to contribute, thx  
Build dir is out of date and will never be updated (gitignored)
